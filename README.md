1. Download the Flutter SDK [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
2. Run “flutter doctor” to ensure that the installation is successful
3. We recommend [AndroidStudio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac) as IDE since the live coding will be done in those IDEs.
4. Open the IDE and install the Flutter plugin by going to **Preferences** ->**Plugins** -> **Marketplace (in the top)**. 
5. Make sure the Flutter SDK path is set by going to **Preference** -> **Languages & Frameworks** -> **Flutter**
6. Once this is done you can create a new Flutter project and run it to make sure everything works. **File** -> **New** -> **Projects** -> **Flutter**
